# mini-shopping-cart-vue 🛒

A simple project that uses the concepts of VueJS I have learned so far,
such as props, mixins and provide-inject.

⚙️ Features:

✅ You can add more items to your product list or subtract them;

✅ You can remove and item from the shopping list

✅ The ammount of the sale will be updated automatically as you increase or decrease the quantity of items, thanks to the computed property of Vue.
